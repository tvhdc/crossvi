# Testing and Debugging

CrossVi runs on real hardware, so debugging usually combines local build checks and on-device logs.

For layout and interaction work without hardware, use the
[X3/X4 desktop UI simulator](./simulator.md). It runs the production renderer
and Activities with clickable controls and exact model-specific framebuffer
dimensions.

## Local checks

Make sure `clang-format` 21+ is installed and available in `PATH` before running the formatting step.
If needed, see [Getting Started](./getting-started.md).

```sh
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check --fail-on-defect low --fail-on-defect medium --fail-on-defect high
pio run
python3 scripts/test_simulator.py
```

## Flash and monitor

Do not use PlatformIO upload for the first CrossVi installation. Use the Web
Flasher procedure in the [README](../../README.md#installation)
and require **Validate partition table** to pass first; PlatformIO's ESP32 upload
target also writes the bootloader, partition table and `otadata` helper.

For a Developer Edition device whose matching partition layout and recovery
path have already been verified, flash a development build with:

```sh
pio run --target upload
```

Open serial monitor:

```sh
pio device monitor
```

Optional enhanced monitor:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py
```

## Useful bug report contents

- Firmware version and build environment
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Serial logs from boot through failure
- Whether the issue reproduces after using the firmware's book-cache command or moving aside only the affected book's generated `sections/` directory (after an SD-card backup)
